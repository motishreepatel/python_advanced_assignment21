    "#Q1: What is a probability distribution, exactly? If the values are meant to be random, how can you predict them at all?\n",
    "#Answer:\n",
    "A probability distribution is a mathematical function that describes the likelihood of different outcomes or events in a random experiment or \n",
    "process. It provides a way to quantify and analyze the uncertainty or randomness associated with the outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In probability theory, a probability distribution assigns probabilities to various possible outcomes. It specifies how likely each outcome \n",
    "is to occur, based on the underlying random variables or parameters. The probability distribution captures the overall pattern or behavior \n",
    "of the random experiment or process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we cannot predict the specific outcome of a random event in a single trial, we can make probabilistic statements about the overall \n",
    "behavior or pattern of outcomes based on the probability distribution. The distribution gives us insights into the relative likelihoods \n",
    "of different outcomes and allows us to make statistical inferences or predictions about the overall behavior of the random process."

    "#Q2 - Is there a distinction between true random numbers and pseudo-random numbers, if there is one? Why are the latter considered “good enough”?\n",
    "#Answer:\n",
    "True Random Numbers: True random numbers are generated from a source that is inherently unpredictable and random. They are not generated by an \n",
    "algorithm or a deterministic process. True random numbers are based on physical phenomena that are inherently random, such as radioactive decay, \n",
    "atmospheric noise, or chaotic systems. They provide a level of randomness that cannot be replicated or predicted.\n",

    "Pseudo-Random Numbers: Pseudo-random numbers, on the other hand, are generated using deterministic algorithms. These algorithms start with a \n",
    "seed value and use mathematical operations to generate a sequence of numbers that appear random. The generated sequence is deterministic, \n",

    "#Q3 - What are the two main factors that influence the behaviour of a &quot;normal&quot; probability distribution?\n",
    "#Answer:\n",
    "The two main factors that influence the behavior of a \"normal\" probability distribution are the mean and the standard deviation. \n",
    "These two parameters define the shape, center, and spread of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean (μ): The mean of a normal distribution represents its center or average value. It determines the location of the peak or the highest \n",
    "point of the bell-shaped curve. A positive mean shifts the distribution to the right, while a negative mean shifts it to the left. \n",
    "The mean is also the measure of the expected value of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation (σ): The standard deviation of a normal distribution represents its spread or variability. It measures the average \n",
    "distance between each data point and the mean. A smaller standard deviation indicates that the data points are closely clustered around the mean, \n",
    "resulting in a narrower and taller bell-shaped curve. Conversely, a larger standard deviation indicates a broader spread of data points, \n",
    "resulting in a wider and flatter curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, the mean and standard deviation fully define the behavior of a normal distribution. The distribution is symmetric around the mean, \n",
    "with the highest probability density at the mean, and it becomes less probable as values move away from the mean in both directions. \n",
    "The standard deviation quantifies the dispersion of data points around the mean, determining the shape and width of the distribution."
